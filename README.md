📊 Project Description
This project presents a Pizza Report Dashboard built in Power BI. It provides deep insights into the performance of a pizza business by analyzing ordering trends, customer behavior, and sales performance.

The dashboard consists of the following key insights:

1. Orders by Day
Visualizes the total number of pizza orders made each day of the week. This helps identify which days are the busiest and which days may require targeted promotions or staffing adjustments.

📅 Example: Higher orders on Friday and Saturday may suggest weekend rush.

2. Orders by Time
Analyzes order volume by specific times of the day (e.g., morning, afternoon, evening, night). This is useful for understanding peak operational hours and planning inventory accordingly.

🕒 Example: Most orders may come in during lunch and dinner hours.

3. Orders by Hour
Breaks down the order data by each hour in a 24-hour cycle. This provides a more granular view compared to the "Orders by Time" visual.

⏰ Example: Maximum orders between 7 PM to 9 PM.

4. Total Sales
Displays the total sales revenue generated over the selected period. This metric gives a quick view of business performance and growth.

💰 Example: Total revenue in a month or year.

5. Pizza Category
Categorizes orders based on the type of pizza ordered (e.g., Classic, Veggie, Meat, Supreme, etc.). This helps in identifying popular pizza categories and planning marketing strategies accordingly.

🍕 Example: Classic pizzas might be ordered more often than gourmet ones.
